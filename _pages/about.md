I am a Master's student at [University of Science and Technology of China](https://en.ustc.edu.cn/) working with [Prof. S. Kevin Zhou](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=8eNm2GMAAAAJ). Before that, I obtained my bacheloar degree at [Tongji University](https://en.tongji.edu.cn).

I am interested in computer vision, mainly about 3D vision and Human-centric topics. Especially, I focus on **Human Mesh Recovery (HMR)** tasks.

Feel free to drop me an [email](alexwdyang@gmail.com) if you are interested in my research.
